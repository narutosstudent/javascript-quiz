# JavaScript Quiz

A rapid quiz with questions and answers.

1. **What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript?**

var is function scoped, let and const are block scoped. var can be redeclared and updated, let can be updated but not redeclared, const can neither be updated nor redeclared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.

This is what redeclaration looks like:

```javascript
var name = "David";
var name = "John";
console.log(name); // John
```

2. **How does JavaScript handle asynchronous operations?**

Handled using callbacks, Promises, and async/await. These constructs allow JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations.

Non-blocking operations are operations that allow other code to be executed while they are being processed.

**How does it work under the hood?**

JavaScript has a single thread, which means it can only execute a single task at a time. However, if it encounters an asynchronous operation, instead of waiting for it to complete, it registers a callback function and moves to the next task. When the asynchronous operation completes, it looks up the appropriate callback function and executes it. This way, it can handle multiple asynchronous operations at a time.

**Where does it register the callback function?**

In the event loop. That is a queue of callback functions that are waiting to be executed.

**How does it know when the async operation is completed?**

It uses the event loop to monitor the programâ€™s execution stack and callback queue. When the stack is empty, it takes the first callback from the queue and pushes it onto the stack.

**What happens if the stack is not empty?**

The callback will have to wait in the queue until the stack is empty.
