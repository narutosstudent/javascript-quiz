# JavaScript Quiz

A rapid quiz with questions and answers.

1. **What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript?**

var is function scoped, let and const are block scoped. var can be redeclared and updated, let can be updated but not redeclared, const can neither be updated nor redeclared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.

This is hwhat redeclaration looks like:

```javascript
var name = "David";
var name = "John";
console.log(name); // John
```
